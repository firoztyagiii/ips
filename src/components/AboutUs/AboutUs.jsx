          <p>
            Imperium Public School was established in the year 2016. At Imperium
            Public SchoolÂ we aspire to take a whole-child approach to elementary
            education. Teachers, administrators, counselors, and support staff
            will work together to meet the intellectual, social, behavioral, and
            emotional needs of each and every child we serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our aim is not only teach children but use the natural curiosity of
            the child to be able to learn what we teach the student. For this we
            are in a process of hiring the most efficient and involved staff to
            be able to guide your child.
          </p>
          <p>
            The location of the school is conducive for an educational
            environment. Spread over 2 acres of land, Imperium Public School
            provides a wholesome approach to education. With a blend of modern
            and traditional techniques we are adamant to provide all the
            facilities which would be needed for the wholesome development of
            the child.
